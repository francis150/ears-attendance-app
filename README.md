# ðŸ•° EARS Client (Mobile App)

**E**lectornic **A**ttendance **R**eal-time **S**olution

This project was the one I made when I was still in school and was still learning a lot of stuff. It was a disaster! ðŸ˜‚ But nonetheless, I still want to share this with you guys.

This app is a real-time employee attendance solution mainly targeted for **multi-branch businesses**.

This Mobile App is the client side of a EARS and is used by Branch Managers to record employee attendance. Allowing the admin side to monitor employee attendance for all its branches.
